# OT/IT with Semantic Web Technologies (SWT)
This repository provides experimental tools for moving between the world of [Operational Technology (OT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology) to the world of Information Technology (IT).  

- __Model Mapper:__ - An implementation of [stOttr](https://dev.spec.ottr.xyz/stOTTR/) with extensions for mapping asset structures based on the Epsilon model transformations-language. Implemented with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in Rust using [Pola.rs](https://www.pola.rs/).  
- __Hybrid Query Engine:__ [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)- and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)-based high throughput access to time series data residing in an arbitrary time series database which is contextualized by a knowledge graph. Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [pola.rs](https://www.pola.rs/), [spargebra](https://docs.rs/spargebra/latest/spargebra/), [sparesults](https://docs.rs/sparesults/0.1.1/sparesults/) and [oxrdf](https://docs.rs/oxrdf/latest/oxrdf/) from the [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) project.  
- __Domain Specific Query Language:__ A customizable query language for accessing time series data using simple generalized paths such as those found in the [Reference Designation System](https://www.iso.org/standard/82229.html) or in [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) information models. The DSQL is parsed with [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/) and translated to the Hybrid Query language.
